This is a website that will have the following features: 
	<p>* Text Editor </p>
	<p>* Code saving on the server side </p>
	<p>* Running your code </p>
	<p>* Project view and other editor UI </p>
<p>Once realising how long it would take to implement the whole text editor manually i have decided to explore other options</p>
<p>Creating a contenteditable element fullfills all of my needs as far as copy pasting and text selecting goes but</p>
<p> the problem is that cant color in the text, and not having syntax colors will make it an unpleasant user experience.</p>
<p> Currently trying to draw colored in text over editable text</p>
